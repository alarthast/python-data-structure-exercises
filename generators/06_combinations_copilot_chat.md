alarthast: Can you explain the `pop`

GitHub Copilot: Certainly!  
In your code, `current.pop()` is used to **backtrack** after exploring a combination.

### Why is `pop()` needed?
- When building combinations recursively, you add an element to `current` with `current.append(list_[i])`.
- After the recursive call finishes, you need to remove that element so you can try the next possibility.
- `pop()` removes the last element, restoring `current` to its previous state before the last addition.

### Analogy
Think of it like exploring branches in a tree:
- You go down one branch (`append`).
- After finishing, you climb back up (`pop`) to try another branch.

### Without `pop()`
If you didn't use `pop()`, `current` would keep growing and include unwanted elements, leading to incorrect combinations.

### Example
Suppose `list_ = [1, 2]`:
- First, `current = [1]`
- Recursively, `current = [1, 2]`
- After yielding `[1, 2]`, `pop()` removes `2`, so `current` is back to `[1]` and can try other options.

alarthast: I do, provide a step-by-step trace

GitHub Copilot: Sure! Let's trace the execution for `list_ = [1, 2]`.

1. Start with an empty `current = []`.
2. Call `generate_combinations_recursive([], 0, 1)` for length 1.
   - Append `1`: `current = [1]`
   - Yield `[1]`
   - Pop `1`: `current = []`
3. Call `generate_combinations_recursive([], 0, 2)` for length 2.
   - Append `1`: `current = [1]`
   - Call `generate_combinations_recursive([1], 1, 2)`
     - Append `2`: `current = [1, 2]`
     - Yield `[1, 2]`
     - Pop `2`: `current = [1]`
   - Pop `1`: `current = []`

The key steps are the `append` to build the combination and `pop` to backtrack. This way, all combinations are explored without duplicates.
